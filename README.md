==========

A small game project involving landing a craft on a specific pad under a certain speed. The program was coded in Java and 
used a small amount of SQL for data storage (high scores).

The program used to store and retrieve high scores after each 'game', however since graduating I no longer have access to 
the University's server. The program has been adapted so that server access is no longer needed, but the code has been left 
in (commented) to give an example of how it was done.

A .jar file is available to test the program as is. The source code has also been provided.

The program was created in Netbeans.
